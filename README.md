<h2>LitServer: Fast, Simple, and Scalable Model Serving </h2>

LitServer is a lightweight, high-performance model-serving framework designed to make deploying machine learning models easy and efficient. Built on Lightning AI, LitServer provides a straightforward way to serve deep learning and machine learning models as RESTful APIs with minimal configuration. Whether you're deploying a computer vision model, natural language processing pipeline, or custom machine learning workflow, LitServer helps streamline model deployment with a focus on speed, scalability, and ease of use.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<h4>Quick Deployment: </h4> Easily deploy machine learning models without complex setup. LitServer supports frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers out of the box.

<h4>High-Performance Inference: </h4> Built with optimized processing to handle high-throughput and low-latency requests, making it ideal for production environments.

<h4>Scalability:  </h4>Supports concurrent request handling with configurable worker threads and process scaling, allowing you to handle multiple requests efficiently.

<h4>FP16 Support: </h4> LitServer can serve models in half-precision (FP16) mode, which reduces memory usage and improves inference speed on compatible hardware.

<h4>Customizable API:  </h4> LitServer allows you to define custom routes and request handling, giving you control over how the model serves and responds to requests.


<h2>LitServe Request Handling </h2>

LitServe, part of the Lightning AI ecosystem, provides a framework for serving machine learning models and handling inference requests. To handle concurrent requests effectively in LitServe, you'll need to leverage scaling, multi-threading, and possibly load balancing to ensure the model server can manage multiple requests at once.

Here are some ways to handle concurrent requests in LitServe:

<h3>1. Use Multiple Workers with LitServe</h3>
LitServe supports running the server with multiple workers. Each worker handles incoming requests concurrently, improving throughput and ensuring that the server can handle multiple requests without blocking.

You can configure multiple workers in the LitServe configuration to enable parallel processing.

Example:

<h3>2. Enable Multi-Threading (For Models with Heavy Inference)</h3>
LitServe can handle multi-threaded requests, especially for CPU-bound tasks like model inference. This can help serve multiple requests at the same time without creating separate processes for each request.

For CPU-bound models, multi-threading allows multiple requests to be processed in parallel by splitting the tasks across available CPU cores. In LitServe, the number of threads can often be controlled based on the underlying model's framework or using server settings.

Example:


<h3>3. Batching Requests for Efficiency</h3>
If your model supports batching (processing multiple inputs at once), you can configure LitServe to batch incoming requests. Batching allows you to process multiple inference requests simultaneously, which improves performance and reduces processing time for each individual request.

You can implement batching logic in the request handler to group multiple requests and send them in a single inference call to the model.

Example:

<h3>4. Asynchronous Request Handling </h3>


If you need better performance with I/O-bound tasks, such as pre- or post-processing, you can handle requests asynchronously. LitServe may provide hooks for async handling, or you can implement async logic using Pythonâ€™s asyncio for non-blocking operations.

Example:


<h3>5. Load Balancing Across Multiple LitServe Instances</h3>

To handle even higher levels of concurrency, you can deploy multiple LitServe instances (possibly in different regions or clusters) and configure a load balancer (like Nginx or HAProxy) or use a cloud-based load balancer (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer, etc.) to distribute traffic across LitServe instances.

This helps in scaling horizontally and ensures that no single instance is overloaded.

Example:
